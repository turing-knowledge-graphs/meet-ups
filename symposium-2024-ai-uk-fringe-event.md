## Agenda (Tentative)

9:00-09:30 &ensp; Registration, poster set up and coffee.

9:30-09:45 &ensp; Welcome to the Fringe event.

9:45-10:30 &ensp; Keynote 1: [Albert Meroño Peñuela](https://www.albertmeronyo.org), King's College London
- **Title**: ***Not Just Graph Databases: Enabling Cultural Intelligence with Multimodal Knowledge Graphs***
- **Abstract**: Knowledge Graphs—graph-shaped knowledge bases that integrate distributed datasets into semantic representations—have demonstrated their impact in the world and are now central in Web search (knowledge panels), virtual assistants, etc. However, we tend to assume that the knowledge that ends up in knowledge graphs comes from particular representations, mostly text or structured databases. At the same time, a sizable number of the use cases in which we deploy KGs have the same unimodal assumption (text/structured data). In this talk, I will challenge these views with the notion of Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), arguing that important knowledge of the world comes from alternative representations (such as music, sound, and images), and that multimodality can enable better access to knowledge for all. I will showcase MMKGs in the domains of digital humanities and cultural heritage as key enablers of intelligent cultural applications.
- **Bio**: Dr Albert Meroño-Peñuela is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science and Knowledge Engineering at the Department of Informatics of King's College London (United Kingdom). His research revolves around the relations between Artificial Intelligence and culture, in particular the semantics of music, multimodal knowledge graphs, and knowledge representation and reasoning for digital humanities and cultural heritage. He has done work in various areas of the semantic web, most prominently in Web Data APIs over RDF Knowledge Graphs.

13:30-14:15 &ensp; Keynote 2: [Uli Sattler](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/), University of Manchester
- **Title**: ***Background Knowledge, Graphs, and Ontologies: Potential and Challenges for Using Knowledge***
- **Abstract**: In recent years, the power of neural models of AI in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing has massively increased due to increased computing power and availability of data. There are, however, still significant challenges in the area, in particular related to issues of transparency, trust, and explainability as well as the reliance on large amounts of training data and computation power. While all these are also addressed by advanced ML techniques, in this talk I want to highlight the potential and challenges of semantic technologies to address these issues. <br>
Knowledge bases, ontologies, knowledge graphs, and related (reasoning and other) tools are semantic technologies that have been developed over the last decades in symbolic AI. They are means to capture and work with rich domain knowledge (e.g., in medicine) in a logically well-founded and computer processable ways, and are being widely used in knowledge-rich areas, e.g., to maintain and interact with medical or bio-chemistry ontologies. <br>
In this talk, I want to discuss how these technologies can be used to address some of the above issues in ML. For example, we explore different ways to equip neural models with relevant background knowledge from ontologies as prior knowledge, so that models can perform better with less training data, and so that we can inspect embeddings through the lens of our background knowledge. I will also talk about using ontologies to evaluate performance of classifiers in a way that takes into account the seriousness of errors, thereby going beyond simple ‘correct/incorrect’ analysis and providing deeper insight into the performance of our models.  
- **Bio**: Uli Sattler is a professor at the University of Manchester, working in logic-based knowledge representation, Description Logics, and ontology engineering. Together with colleagues, she designed the family of Description Logics underpinning ontology languages such as OWL and decision procedures for relevant reasoning problems of these logics. She has been working on a range of novel reasoning problems that are important for ontology engineering and usage such as module extraction and decomposition, entailment explanation, and mining axioms from data. Uli completed her PhD under the supervision of Franz Baader at RWTH Aachen and her habilitation at TU Dresden.

14:15-15:15 &ensp; **Panel about the Future of AI and the role of KGs**<br>
KGs are seen as an enabling technology for many intelligent applications. The panel explores what the AI landscape is likely to be in the future, the role KGs will play and the impact AI will have in different areas.
