## Agenda

9:30 - 10:00    Coffee and poster set-up

10:00 - 10:30   Welcome and Opening ([slides](), video: [presentation](), [camera]())
> - Welcome from City and [The Turing University Network](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-university-network)
> - Opening by the [IG organisers](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/knowledge-graphs)

10:30 - 11:15   Keynote by [Chris Welty](https://research.google/people/104789/) (Google Research)

> **Title**:  Addressing Label Sparsity With Class-Level Common Sense (video: [presentation](), [camera]())
 
> **Abstract**: The vast majority of business problems are prevented from deploying machine learning solutions due to label sparsity -- the lack of labeled data to train large models.  This major problem is overshadowed by continued successes in problems that, often, naturally have a lot of data (for example, Netflix has millions of examples of what movies people watch).  At Google, we recently launched a new enhancement to search that allows product and dish queries, such as "Milk", "12 string guitar", or "spaghetti bolognese" to return local results - places on maps, nearby, that sell the product or serve the dish.  The problem had remained unsolved at Google for more than 10 years because of label sparsity: 70% of stores and restaurants worldwide - and 40% in the US - do not have a web page, Google's primary data source for search.  To overcome this challenge and extend our understanding of small-medium sized brick & mortar shops and restaurants, we used a unique combination of Knowledge Graphs, AI and Human Common Sense (e.g., [[1]](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/HCOMP/article/view/18947), [[2]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.830299/full)), that demonstrates both the promises and limitations of AI in solving practical business problems.

12:45 - 13:45   Lunch and Networking

13:45 - 14:30   Keynote by [Lora Aroyo](https://research.google/people/LoraAroyo/) (Google Research)

> **Title**:  The reasonable effectiveness of diverse data

> **Abstract**:  The efficacy of machine learning (ML) models depends on both algorithms and data. Training data defines what we want our models to learn, and testing data provides the means by which their empirical progress is measured. Benchmark datasets define the entire world within which models exist and operate, yet research continues to focus on critiquing and improving the algorithmic aspect of the models rather than critiquing and improving the data with which our models operate. If "data is the new oil," we are still missing work on the refineries by which the data itself could be optimized for more effective use. In this talk, I will discuss data excellence and lessons learned from software engineering to achieve the scare and rigor in assessing data quality. 

> **Bio**: Lora Aroyo is a senior research scientist at Google Research where she leads the DEER team - Data Excellence for Evaluating Responsibly. Her team focuses on metrics and strategies to measure quality of human-labeled data in a reliable and transparent way - specifically interested in dealing with content ambiguity and rater disagreement. Prior to joining Google, Lora was a computer science professor heading the User-Centric Data Science research group at the VU University Amsterdam. She co-invented with Chris Welty the CrowdTruth crowdsourcing method and applied it in various domains such as digital humanities, medical and online multimedia. Lora guided the human-in-the-loop strategies as a Chief Scientist at a NY-based startup Tagasauris. Currently also president of the User Modeling Society.
