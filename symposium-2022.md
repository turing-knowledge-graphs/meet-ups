## Agenda

The focus of this first symposium is to create a sandbox for future collaborations and joint applications for funding. 
Following the series of meetups we had in the past year, in which we discussed topics such as teaching curricula, use cases, and applications of knowledge graphs, 
we invite all participants interested in collaborations to register their interest to do short pitches and attend the matchmaking session.
