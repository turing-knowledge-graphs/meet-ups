## 1st Annual Symposium of the Knowledge Graphs IG at the Alan Turing Institute

- **When:** June 17th 2022 (10am-4pm BST), at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/how-get-alan-turing-institute) (Enigma room).
- **Format:** up to 45 participants in person and broadcasted online. 
- **Registration:** via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/1st-annual-symposium-of-the-knowledge-graphs-ig-the-alan-turing-institute-tickets-310987932277). In person registration closes on June 3rd, 2022. Because of space constraints, maximum 2 people per organisation or group may attend in person. 

## Agenda

The focus of this first symposium is to create a sandbox for future collaborations and joint applications for funding. 
Following the series of meetups we had in the past year, in which we discussed topics such as teaching curricula, use cases, and applications of knowledge graphs, 
we invite all participants interested in collaborations to register their interest to do short pitches and attend the matchmaking session.

 > **Title**: Facilitating causality in science with cognitive knowledge graphs

 > **Abstract**: Knowledge graphs are meanwhile established representation forms for heterogeneous data and knowledge. However, knowledge graphs are still relatively simple structures with limited possibilities to represent and efficiently manage more complex structures, provenance, evolution or different levels of granularity. In this talk we will introduce the concept of cognitive knowledge graphs, which use richer atomic base entities - graphlets as constituents. With the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), we present an example of such a cognitive knowledge graph, which closely intertwines human and machine intelligence with the aim of semantically representing research contributions. As a result, the ORKG provides a digital research infrastructure enabling researchers and other stakeholders to obtain better oversight over the millions of annual research publications and better machine assistance for analysing the wealth of scholarly knowledge.

 > **Title**: FAIR, community standards and data FAIRification: components and recipes

 > **Abstract**: The FAIR Principles have succeeded to unit stakeholders world-wide behind a common concept: good data management under common standards. However, FAIR is aspirational and putting FAIR into practice is work in progress, and it "takes a village".  We will provide an overview of two community-driven resources, and how they contribute to the necessary guidelines to turn FAIR into reality. FAIRsharing (https://fairsharing.org), which focuses on promotive the value and use of community standards and terminologies, key elements of FAIR; and the FAIR Cookbook (https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org), which leverages the expertise of data professional in academia and industry to deliver recipes that address all operational aspects of making and keeping data FAIR.
